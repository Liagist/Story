Hello how are you?
I'm really not sure how I'm feeling about being on this break with ben. Most days I don't even know if I want to be with him, but now I'm finding myself truly miss him. Do I miss the attention and comfort of knowing someone out there is in love with me, am I missing the idea in my head about what he could potentially be? Or is it just that I am falling victim to the "can't have" reverse psychology of the grass is always greener? Either way, I'm feeling lonelier than I have all week, and I just want to reach out to someone.
